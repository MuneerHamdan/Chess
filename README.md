# Chess
Todo:
 - fix turn system
   - legal moves showing up as illegal even though they are being played
   - example: e2 e4, f1 b5 (is actually illegal bc white is playing during blacks turn), a7 a6 (board updates to play it but sends message illegalmove)
 - check
 - checkmate
 - castling needs to check if rook moved in the game already
 - original move string organization
 - reset quit
